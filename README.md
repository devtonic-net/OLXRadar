## Usage. How to schedule the app to run at fixed intervals

**On Windows**

Make sure you logged on as an administrator or you have the same access as an administrator, then go to:

```
Start -> Control Panel -> System and Security -> Administrative Tools -> Task Scheduler
Action -> Create Basic Task -> Type a name and Click Next
```    
Follow through the wizard.


**On Linux**
   
   1. Open the crontab configuration file by running the following command:
      ```
      crontab -e
      ```
   2. Add the following line to the end of the file to run the app every 30 minutes:
      ```
      */30 * * * * /path/to/OLXRadar/venv/bin/python /path/to/OLXRadar/main.py
      ```
      Replace `/path/to/OLXRadar` with the actual path to the project directory.

The app will fetch the list of URLs to monitor from `target_urls.txt`, scrape new ads, and send alerts via email and Telegram.
